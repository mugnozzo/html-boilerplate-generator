# html-boilerplate-generator

This is a basic HTML boilerplate generator. It's written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Installation
### Use it online as it is
If you just want to use it as it is, the generator (main branch of this repo) is hosted [here](https://mugnozzo.xyz/html-boilerplate-generator).

You don't need to install anything. Just clone the repository or directly download the html, css and js files and open the html file in a browser.

### Host it locally or where you want
#### Cloning the repo
Just clone the repository:

```
cd /path/where/you/want/to/clone/the/repo
git clone https://github.com/mugnozzo/html-boilerplate-generator.git
 ```
and visit the index.html file with your favorite browser.

#### Downloading the files
You can also download the files (remember the license) and host them where you need.

## Usage
Hopefully you are a developer. In that case the generator is quite simple to use. You will see how the code changes as you fill the text inputs or check/uncheck the checkboxes.
